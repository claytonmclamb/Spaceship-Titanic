# Spaceship-Titanic

Spaceship Titanic is a Kaggle Competition where users predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension!
This repository will be used to store my notebooks, document my progress, and share my results!

## About the Data

|Variable | Description |
|-|-|
| PassengerId | A unique Id for each passenger. Each Id takes the form gggg_pp where gggg indicates a group the passenger is travelling with and pp is their number within the group. People in a group are often family members, but not always. |
| Home Planet | The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence. | 
| CryoSleep |  Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage. Passengers in cryosleep are confined to their cabins. | 
| Cabin | The cabin number where the passenger is staying. Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for Port or S for Starboard. |
| Destination | The planet the passenger will be debarking to |
| Age | The age of the passenger |
| VIP | Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage | 
| RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck | Amount the passenger has billed at each of the Spaceship Titanic's many luxury amenities. |
| Name | The first and last names of the passenger |
| Transported | Whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the target, the column you are trying to predict. | 

## Purpose behind this Project

There are three main purposes behind this project:
* I wanted to demonstrate my skills using the package **pandas**
* I wanted practice using classification algorithms (**KNN**, **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, **CatBoost**, **Naive Bayes**, **SVM**)
* I wanted to learn new classification algorithms (**Logistic Regression**, **CatBoost**, **NaiveBayes**, **SVM**)
